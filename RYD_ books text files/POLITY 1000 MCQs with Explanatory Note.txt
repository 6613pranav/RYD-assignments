(b) The planning commission was not provided by the constitution of India.

(b) The word minority is not defined in the constitution of India, yet it recognizes two types of minorities, based on religion and language. The minorities commission is a statutory body constituted in 1993 by an act of Parliament.

(c) The central Information Commission was established by the central government in 2005. It was constituted through an official Gazette Notification under the provisions of the Right to Information act (2005). Hence, It is not a constitutional body.

(c)

(a) The first Commission was constituted in 1992 with

Shri S.H. Ramdhan as chairman. The second Commission was constituted in October 1995 with Shri H. Hanumanthappa as chairman.

The 65th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1990 provided for the establishment of a high level National Commission for SCs and STs.

The 89th constitution Amendment Act of 2003 bifurcated the Combined National Commission for SCs and STs into two separate bodies.

(a)  Tamil  Nadu  and  Andhra  pradesh  have  already  set  up Lokayauktas. So the incorrect answer is option (a)  . The Lokayukta appointed by the people is an anti-corruption

ombudsman organization in the Indian states. The Administrative Reforms Commission (ARC) headed by Morarji Desai submitted a special interim report on “Problems of Redressal of Citizen’s Grievances” in 1966. In this report, the ARC recommended the setting up of two special authorities designated as ‘Lokpal’ and ‘Lokayukta’ for the redressal of citizens’ grievances.

(b) The award of the Lok Adalat is fictionally deemed to be decrees of Court and therefore the court has all the powers in relation thereto as it has in relation to a decree passed by itself. This includes the powers to extend time in appropriate cases. The award passed by the Lok Adalat is the decision of the court itself, though, arrived at by the simpler method of conciliation instead of the process of arguments in court.

(a) The Planning Commission was set up by a Resolution of the Government of India in March 1950.It is not provided in the constitution of India.

(d)  Award has the same effect as of a Civil Court decree. The Supreme Court has held that award of the Lok Adalat is as

good as the decree of a Court. The award of the Lok Adalat is fictionally deemed to be decrees of Court and therefore the courts have all the powers in relation thereto as it has in relation to a decree passed by itself. It was the legal services authority act 1987, which gave statutory status to Lok Adalat.

(c) The Planning Commission was established in March 1950 by an executive resolution of the Government of India, on the recommendation of the Advisory Planning Board constituted in 1946, under the chairmanship of KC Neogi.
